**Why this project**

Built to practice structuring larger JavaScript codebases without frameworks.

Using DOM only was the main challenge.

**How to play**

This game uses keyboard controls only

- Arrows - to move and change menu values
- Enter - in menu only
- Spacebar - to shoot
- Holding down spacebar during intro speeds up the dialog
